📘 Hindi-Speaking Voice Assistant — Documentation
🎯 Project Summary

This project is a Hindi-speaking AI voice assistant that can:

✅ Listen to your voice (Hindi)
✅ Convert speech → text (offline)
✅ Understand the text and generate a reply (rule-based logic)
✅ Convert reply → speech (Hindi) and speak it
✅ Optionally detect your face using webcam before listening

The system works without any paid APIs and can run offline (except gTTS uses internet for voice generation).
🛠️ Technologies / APIs Used & Why

1. Vosk
Used for Speech-to-Text (Hindi).
Reason: Completely offline Hindi voice recognition, no API keys or internet needed.

2. vosk-model-small-hi-0.22
Hindi ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model used by Vosk.
Reason: Lightweight Hindi speech model that runs locally on CPU.

3. gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
Used to convert Hindi text into spoken audio.
Reason: Easy to use and produces natural-sounding Hindi voice.

4. sounddevice
Captures microphone audio.
Reason: Simple and reliable Python library for real-time mic input.

5. soundfile + numpy
Used for handling raw audio data.
Reason: Needed for reading, writing, and processing audio efficiently.

6. playsound
Plays the generated speech audio.
Reason: Very simple cross-platform playback solution on Windows.

7. OpenCV (optional)
Used for face detection through webcam.
Reason: Haar cascade-based face detection is lightweight and works without needing deep learning models.

🖥️ Setup & Installation (Windows)
1️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

2️⃣ Upgrade Pip
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

3️⃣ Install Required Libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Download Hindi Vosk Model

Download from: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models

Choose vosk-model-small-hi-0.22

Extract it in project directory like:

project/
    vosk-model-small-hi-0.22/

▶️ How to Run
✅ To run with pre-recorded audio file
python main.py --file record_out_16k.wav

🎤 To run with microphone + face detection
python main.py

🕹️ Controls
Action	How
Speak	Start program & talk in Hindi
Stop Listening	Press Ctrl + C once
Exit Program	Say "अलविदा" / "बाय" or press Ctrl + C twice
🧠 Response Logic (Hindi)

Example rules implemented:

Greetings → "नमस्ते, मैं आपकी सहायता के लिए तैयार हूँ।"

Asking name → "मेरा नाम वॉइस सहायक है।"

Weather queries → "क्षमा करें, मैं अभी मौसम की जानकारी नहीं दे सकता।"

Unknown input → "मैं समझ नहीं पाया, कृपया दोबारा बोलें।"

🚧 Challenges & Solutions
Problem	Reason	Fix
Model not loading	Wrong directory path	Added clear error message & path validation
Mic overflow	Audio buffer issues	Tuned buffer size & flatten numpy array
OpenCV crash	No GUI window support	Removed display windows & used direct detection
Only 1-turn conversation	Loop ended after 1 query	Added while-loop with exit intent
gTTS online	Internet needed	Documented + offline alternative pyttsx3 suggested
💡 Ideas for Improvement
✅ Short-Term

Replace gTTS → pyttsx3 offline

Add fallback for unclear speech

Add logging of conversations

🚀 Mid-Term

Wake-word detection ("नमस्ते साथी")

Small NLU model for deeper intent understanding

Keyword-based FAQ mode

🌟 Advanced

Coqui-TTS → neural Hindi offline voice

GUI using Tkinter / Streamlit

Memory for long conversations

Multi-language (Hindi-English) switching
